I'm Jamie Sharpe, a digital forensic investigator and software developer for Greater Manchester Police, UK.

I have been writing software for 10+ years, with 3 years in the digital forensic field.

### Software

The majority of my software is built with Python, although I am familiar with the C family of languages and have experience in full stack web developement.

Most of my software development involves creating data parsers and automation. I also work on some larger scale solutions to promote higher standards within the organisation.
